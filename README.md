# Chinese Utilities

- `dict_io.py`: parse CC-CEDICT dictionary and Pleco flashcards txt exports

- `charflashs.py`: generate opinionated flashcards for every single character with word examples (for pleco flashcards import)
  - to be used on the PAVC txt flashcards from https://www.plecoforums.com/threads/practical-audio-visual-chinese-dictionary-and-flashcards.2403/

quick run: `bash run.sh`
(or if everything is allready installed and downloaded: `python charflashs.py data/cedict_ts.u8 "data/AV Chinese Flashcards.txt"`)

# TODO: list words for each char by HSK or TOEFCL level that requires that word
